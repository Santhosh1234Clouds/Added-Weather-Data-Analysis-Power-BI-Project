# 🌤️ Weather Data Analysis | Power BI Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard project developed to analyze multi-year weather data (2021–2024), uncovering temperature patterns, rainfall variations, and seasonal trends across different periods.
This project reflects my analytical and visualization expertise — transforming raw datasets into insightful, data-driven visuals that support climate monitoring and decision-making.

🔍 Project Overview


Developed a dynamic Power BI dashboard to track key weather metrics over multiple years.


Utilized Power Query Editor for data cleaning, transformation, and merging multiple CSV files (2021–2024) to ensure consistency and accuracy.


Designed and implemented custom DAX measures and interactive KPIs, including:


### 🌡️ Average Temperature
 

### ☔ Total Rainfall


### 💧 Humidity Index


### 📈 Year-over-Year Climate Change




Integrated slicers and filters for user-friendly exploration by year, month, and weather conditions.


Created line charts, heatmaps, and area visuals to highlight long-term seasonal variations and trends.


Delivered actionable insights by identifying extreme weather periods and rainfall deviations, contributing to environmental and agricultural analysis.
